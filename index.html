            <h2>Missile Man of India</h2>
            <p>
              <b>APJ Abdul Kalam,</b> full name Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul
              Kalam, was an Indian scientist and politician who served as the
              11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born on October
              15, 1931, in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, India, and passed away on
              July 27, 2015. Kalam was known as the "People's President" due to
              his popularity and connection with the youth of India. He came
              from a humble background and overcame several hardships to become
              one of the most respected figures in the country. He played a
              pivotal role in India's missile development and nuclear weapons
              program, earning him the nickname "Missile Man of India." Kalam's
              scientific contributions include his work on India's first
              Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) and the development of
              strategic missiles such as Agni and Prithvi. He played a key role
              in the successful Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, which
              established India as a nuclear power. Beyond his scientific
              achievements, Kalam was an inspiration to millions of people,
              especially the youth. He was known for his motivational speeches,
              emphasizing the importance of education, hard work, and
              perseverance. Kalam encouraged young people to dream big and
              strive to achieve their goals, often using himself as an example
              of someone who rose from humble beginnings to reach great heights.
              After his presidency, Kalam remained active in various capacities,
              promoting education, innovation, and social welfare. He was
              involved in several educational institutions and organizations,
              working towards providing quality education to all and nurturing
              scientific temperament among the youth. APJ Abdul Kalam was widely
              recognized and honored for his contributions. He received numerous
              awards and accolades, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest
              civilian award, in 1997. His inspirational life story and his
              dedication to the progress of the nation continue to inspire
              generations of Indians.
